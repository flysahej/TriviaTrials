# TriviaTrials 

## Description of Software 
This game application seeks to encourage individuals to effectively apply previous knowledge to concepts in an interactive and immersive environment with an aesthetic user interface experience designed for 16-18 year old students. With a board-based design, competitive and time sensitive scoring system, and multiplayer dimension, players will be incentivised to challenge increasingly complex problems, as they progress across the board, to benefit their growth. Instructors will have the option to monitor students' learning achievements in real time to provide personalized supports for students. Alterations to the game will also be conveniently processed through a debug feature, available to future developers/maintainers. Through this game, students will develop fundamentals critical to success in an increasingly dynamic society.
